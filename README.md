# 💻 About Me
Hi there! 👋 I'm Usam Amjad, a passionate AI/ML/DL researcher and developer. I specialize in building intelligent systems using Generative AI and Natural Language Processing. I also work extensively with LangChain, LangGraph, and both conventional and vector databases to craft efficient, scalable solutions. My primary coding tool is Python, and I enjoy creating robust web applications using FastAPI and Flask.
